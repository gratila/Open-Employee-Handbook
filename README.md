Open Employee Handbook
----------------------

We live in an amazing time, the entire world is shifting to a culture of
work which emphasizes on building amazing things without doing the
boring stuff people did for many years in past. Ecosystem of tech
startups has greatly contributed to a "no-nonsense" culture of work
where people are focused on achieving what they want, yet at  times, its
hard to keep everybody reminded about the culture, values & practices
which makes them a "rockstar team". Open Employee Handbook is a
companion book that can be used by any startup to define their culture
and practices which will help keep the entire team on same page.

The reason for starting out this open initiative is that creating a
handbook of this sort requires lot of effort and quite often ignored by
aggressive startup teams (just because they dont have bandwidth) or its
being repeated in many companies again and again re-inventing the same
wheel.
